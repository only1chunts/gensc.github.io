User of Chrome browsers please note since  Chrome v88 the browser no longer allows FTP download. Since all our data is currently hosted on an FTP server this may prevent simply clicking the download button on the browser.

For details on the Chrome reasoning for removal of this functionality please see [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/12/chrome-88-deps-rems)

To download files directly from the browser you will need to use a different browser, e.g. Firefox or Safari

Alternatively if downloading multiple files you may find using an FTP client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php) would be more appropriate.
For using FileZilla the server Host is "parrot.genomics.cn" there is no username or password required as its anonymous FTP.
